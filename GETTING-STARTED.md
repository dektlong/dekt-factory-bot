## Configuration Overview

Goose Agent Chat uses two main configuration files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.goose-config.yml` | Goose CLI configuration (providers, MCP servers, skills) |
| `manifest.yml` | Cloud Foundry deployment settings and environment variables |

The `.goose-config.yml` file is located in `src/main/resources/` and gets bundled into the application JAR during build.

---

## Configuring LLM Providers

### Supported Providers

Goose supports multiple LLM providers:

| Provider | Environment Variable | Example Models |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | gpt-5.2-chat-latest |
| Google | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | gemini-2.5-pro |
| Databricks | `DATABRICKS_HOST`, `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` | databricks-meta-llama-3-1-70b-instruct |
| Ollama | `OLLAMA_HOST` | llama3.1, codellama |

### Setting the Provider and Model

Edit `.goose-config.yml` to configure your preferred provider:

```yaml
# LLM Provider configuration
provider: anthropic
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Or for OpenAI:
# provider: openai
# model: gpt-5.2-chat-latest
```

### Setting API Keys

**For local development**, set environment variables:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx
# Or for OpenAI:
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
```

**For Cloud Foundry**, configure keys in `vars.yaml` or through CredHub (see [Cloud Foundry Deployment](#cloud-foundry-deployment)).

---

## Adding MCP Servers

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers extend Goose's capabilities by providing access to external tools and data sources.

### MCP Server Types

| Type | Transport | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `streamable_http` | HTTP/SSE | Remote servers accessible over the network |
| `stdio` | Standard I/O | Local servers running as child processes |

### Adding Remote MCP Servers (Recommended for Cloud Foundry)

Remote MCP servers are ideal for Cloud Foundry deployments since they don't require additional binaries in the container.

```yaml
# .goose-config.yml
mcpServers:
  # Cloud Foundry MCP server for CF operations
  - name: cloud-foundry
    type: streamable_http
    url: "https://cloud-foundry-mcp-server.apps.example.com/mcp"

  # GitHub MCP server for repository operations
  - name: github
    type: streamable_http
    url: "https://github-mcp-server.apps.example.com/mcp"
```

### Adding Local MCP Servers

Local MCP servers run as child processes. These are useful for development but require the server binary/runtime to be available in the container.

```yaml
# .goose-config.yml
mcpServers:
  # Filesystem access (requires Node.js in container)
  - name: filesystem
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args:
      - "-y"
      - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
    env:
      ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES: "/home/vcap/app,/tmp"

  # GitHub access via stdio (requires Node.js + token)
  - name: github
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args:
      - "-y"
      - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
    env:
      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

> **Note:** For Cloud Foundry deployments, prefer `streamable_http` servers since `stdio` servers may require additional runtimes (Node.js, Python) that aren't included in the standard Java buildpack.

---

## OAuth2-Protected MCP Servers

Some MCP servers require user authentication via OAuth2. Goose Agent Chat supports the [MCP Authorization specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization) with OAuth 2.1 and PKCE.

### How It Works

1. **Discovery**: When you add an MCP server with `requiresAuth: true`, the application discovers OAuth endpoints automatically
2. **User Consent**: Users see an "OAuth Connect" button in the UI for protected servers
3. **Authorization**: Users are redirected to the authorization server (e.g., GitHub) to grant access
4. **Token Management**: Tokens are stored server-side and automatically refreshed

### Configuration Options

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `requiresAuth` | Enable OAuth2 authentication | Yes |
| `clientId` | Pre-registered OAuth client ID | For servers without dynamic registration |
| `clientSecret` | OAuth client secret | For confidential clients |
| `scopes` | Space-separated OAuth scopes | Optional (auto-discovered if not set) |

### Example: GitHub MCP Server

GitHub's remote MCP server requires OAuth authentication:

#### Step 1: Create a GitHub OAuth App

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/developers
2. Click "New OAuth App"
3. Set the callback URL to: `https://your-app.apps.example.com/oauth/callback`
4. Note the Client ID and generate a Client Secret

#### Step 2: Configure the MCP Server

```yaml
# .goose-config.yml
mcpServers:
  - name: github
    type: streamable_http
    url: "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    requiresAuth: true
    clientId: ${GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID}
    clientSecret: ${GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET}
    scopes: "repo read:org user:email"
```

#### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Add to your `vars.yaml`:

```yaml
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: Iv1.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: your-client-secret-here
```

#### Step 4: Deploy and Connect

```bash
mvn clean package && cf push --vars-file vars.yaml
```

After deployment, the GitHub MCP server will show an "OAuth Connect" button. Click it to authorize access.

### OAuth Scopes

Scopes determine what permissions the OAuth token has. The application selects scopes in this priority order:

1. **Explicit configuration** - `scopes` field in `.goose-config.yml` (recommended)
2. **WWW-Authenticate header** - Scopes from the server's 401 response
3. **Protected Resource Metadata** - From RFC 9728 discovery
4. **Authorization Server Metadata** - From RFC 8414 discovery (broadest)

For GitHub, common scopes include:

| Scope | Access |
|-------|--------|
| `repo` | Full access to repositories (issues, PRs, code) |
| `public_repo` | Access to public repositories only |
| `read:org` | Read organization membership |
| `user:email` | Read user email addresses |

### Servers with Dynamic Client Registration

For MCP servers that support RFC 7591 Dynamic Client Registration, you don't need `clientId` or `clientSecret`:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: my-mcp-server
    type: streamable_http
    url: "https://mcp-server.example.com/mcp"
    requiresAuth: true
    # Uses dynamic registration - no credentials needed
```

The application automatically uses a Client ID Metadata Document as the client identifier.

### Troubleshooting OAuth

#### "403 Forbidden" after authentication

Your token doesn't have the required scopes. Add explicit scopes to your configuration:

```yaml
scopes: "repo read:org user:email"
```

Then disconnect and reconnect to get a new token with the correct permissions.

#### "Invalid or expired state parameter"

The OAuth session expired. Try initiating the flow again by clicking "OAuth Connect".

#### OAuth server returns 404

The server may not support dynamic client registration. You need to:
1. Register an OAuth application with the provider
2. Add `clientId` and `clientSecret` to your configuration

## Configuring Skills

Skills are reusable instruction sets that teach Goose how to perform specific tasks. They follow the [Goose Skills format](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/context-engineering/using-skills).

### Skill Types

#### 1. Remote Git-Based Skills

Clone skills from a Git repository during Cloud Foundry staging:

```yaml
# .goose-config.yml
skills:
  - name: cf-space-auditor
    source: https://github.com/org/goose-skills.git
    branch: main
    path: plugins/cf-space-auditor/skills/cf-space-auditor

  - name: company-standards
    source: https://github.com/org/goose-skills.git
    branch: main
    path: skills/company-standards
```

> **Note:** Git-based skills require network access during Cloud Foundry staging.

#### 2. Local File-Based Skills

Reference skills from directories bundled with your application:

```yaml
# .goose-config.yml
skills:
  - name: deployment
    path: .goose/skills/deployment
```

The skill directory must contain a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: deployment
description: Deployment workflow for this project
---

# Deployment Steps
1. Build the application
2. Run integration tests
3. Deploy to staging
4. Verify health checks
5. Deploy to production
```

Place skill directories in `src/main/resources/skills/` so they're bundled in the JAR.

#### 3. Inline Skills

Embed skill content directly in the configuration:

```yaml
# .goose-config.yml
skills:
  - name: code-review
    description: Comprehensive code review checklist
    content: |
      # Code Review Checklist
      When reviewing code, check each of these areas:
      
      ## Functionality
      - [ ] Code does what the PR description claims
      - [ ] Edge cases are handled properly
      
      ## Code Quality
      - [ ] Follows project style guide
      - [ ] No hardcoded values that should be configurable
      - [ ] Appropriate error handling
```

---

## Building and Deploying

### Building the Application

Build the application using Maven, which compiles the Java backend and Angular frontend:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This command:

1. **Compiles Java sources** - Builds the Spring Boot application
2. **Installs Node.js** - Downloads Node.js v22.12.0 to `target/` directory
3. **Installs npm dependencies** - Runs `npm ci` in `src/main/frontend/`
4. **Builds Angular frontend** - Runs `npm run build` to create production bundle
5. **Copies frontend assets** - Places built Angular app into `target/classes/static/`
6. **Packages JAR** - Creates `target/goose-agent-chat-1.0.0.jar` with embedded frontend

The resulting JAR file contains both the Spring Boot backend and the Angular frontend as static resources.

### Build Dependencies

The build process pulls dependencies from these repositories:

| Artifact | Repository | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `goose-cf-wrapper` | `us-central1-maven.pkg.dev/cf-mcp/maven-public` | Goose CLI wrapper for Cloud Foundry |
| `java-cfenv-boot-tanzu-genai` | Maven Central | Tanzu GenAI service binding support |
| Spring Boot dependencies | Maven Central | Framework dependencies |

> **Note:** The `goose-cf-wrapper` artifact is hosted in a custom GCP Artifact Registry and is automatically resolved during the build.

### Deploying to Cloud Foundry

Once built, deploy the application to Cloud Foundry:

```bash
cf push
```

Or with variable substitution for secrets:

```bash
cf push --vars-file vars.yaml
```

#### What Happens During Deployment

1. **Upload** - Pushes the JAR file (`target/goose-agent-chat-1.0.0.jar`) to Cloud Foundry
2. **Staging** - Cloud Foundry runs the buildpacks:
   - `goose-buildpack` - Downloads and installs Goose CLI
   - `java_buildpack_offline` - Configures JRE 21 and starts the application
3. **Starting** - Application starts and listens on the assigned port
4. **Binding** - Cloud Foundry injects service credentials if services are bound

#### Verifying the Deployment

After deployment completes, verify the application is running:

```bash
# Check application status
cf app goose-agent-chat

# View logs
cf logs goose-agent-chat --recent

# Test the health endpoint
curl https://goose-agent-chat.apps.example.com/api/chat/health
```

Expected health response:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "source": "environment"
}
```

#### Redeploying After Configuration Changes

After modifying `.goose-config.yml` or other resources:

```bash
# Rebuild and redeploy in one step
mvn clean package && cf push --vars-file vars.yaml
```

---

## Cloud Foundry Deployment

### Customizing manifest.yml

The `manifest.yml` file controls Cloud Foundry deployment settings:

```yaml
applications:
  - name: goose-agent-chat
    path: target/goose-agent-chat-1.0.0.jar
    memory: 2G
    buildpacks:
      - https://github.com/cpage-pivotal/goose-buildpack
      - java_buildpack_offline
    env:
      JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE: '{ jre: { version: 21.+ } }'
      GOOSE_ENABLED: true
      
      # API key for your provider (use CredHub for production)
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ((ANTHROPIC_API_KEY))
      # OPENAI_API_KEY: ((OPENAI_API_KEY))
      # GOOGLE_API_KEY: ((GOOGLE_API_KEY))
```

### Using vars.yaml for Secrets

For local deployments, create a `vars.yaml` file (excluded from git):

```yaml
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: sk-ant-xxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY: sk-xxxxx
```

Deploy with:

```bash
cf push --vars-file vars.yaml
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GOOSE_ENABLED` | Enable Goose CLI integration |
| `GOOSE_CLI_PATH` | Path to Goose binary (set by buildpack) |
| `GOOSE_PROVIDER` | Override default provider |
| `GOOSE_MODEL` | Override default model |
| `GOOSE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` | Execution timeout (default: 5) |
| `GOOSE_MAX_TURNS` | Max conversation turns (default: 100) |

## Tanzu Marketplace Integration

When deploying to Cloud Foundry with Tanzu Marketplace, you can bind to GenAI services that provide chat models. **Bound GenAI services take precedence over locally configured models.**

### How It Works

1. **Service Binding**: When a GenAI service is bound to your application, Cloud Foundry injects credentials via `VCAP_SERVICES`

2. **Auto-Discovery**: The application automatically discovers available TOOLS-capable models from the bound service

3. **Precedence**: GenAI service models override any provider/model configuration in `.goose-config.yml` or environment variables

### Binding a GenAI Service

```bash
# Create a GenAI service instance from Tanzu Marketplace
cf create-service genai standard my-genai-service

# Bind to your application
cf bind-service goose-agent-chat my-genai-service

# Restage to pick up the binding
cf restage goose-agent-chat
```

### Configuration Priority

The application determines which model to use in this order:

1. **GenAI Service Binding** (highest priority) - Models from Tanzu Marketplace
2. **Session Configuration** - Provider/model specified when creating a chat session
3. **Environment Variables** - `GOOSE_PROVIDER`, `GOOSE_MODEL`
4. **Configuration File** - Settings in `.goose-config.yml`

### Verifying the Active Model

Use the health endpoint to see which model is active:

```bash
curl https://goose-agent-chat.apps.example.com/api/chat/health
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4-turbo",
  "source": "genai-service"
}
```

The `source` field indicates whether the model is from `genai-service` or `environment`.

### Bypassing GenAI Service

To temporarily use locally configured models instead of the bound GenAI service:

```bash
cf set-env goose-agent-chat BYPASS_GENAI true
cf restage goose-agent-chat
```
